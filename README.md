Purpose: Simulate what a jumping spider might see when they look at an object
         in the night sky.

Background: This little project was born out of a fascinating collision of
            astronomy and biology on Twitter. It involved spiders falling out
            of ceilings onto astronomer Jamie Lomax, red and green laser
            pointers, spider biologists and spider vision laboratories, and a
            whole host of interested followers. For the most succinct
            explanation, perhaps reading these articles by Ed Yong or Nadia
            Drake would do?
